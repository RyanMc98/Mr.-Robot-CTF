# Mr.-Robot-CTF

Hello friend. The following directorys hold Write Ups for all flags if you get stuck in doing the challenges or just starting out in CTFs and want to learn about the methods of getting flags and learnig new tools and techniques. All flags include a little something of what is learnt in Digital Forensics & Cyber Security in 3rd year. The reason for this CTF is to provide students with a learning platform that might be a students very first CTF or they don't know much about Cyber security and want to see is this for them. If you enjoy this CTF please give feedback as I want to make this CTF as helpful as possible to everyone. If theres something wrong with the write ups or you still don't understand the flag because the write up isnt clear enough please get in contact with me at B00094327@tudublin.ie and I'll be happy to help and solve any issues.
